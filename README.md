# FactorialOfNumber
In mathematics, the notation n! represents the factorial of the nonnegative integer n. The factorial of n is the product of all the nonnegative integers from 1 to n. For example,

7! = 1x2x3x4x5x6x7 = 5,040 and 4! =1x2x3x4 = 24

Write a program that uses user_input as a nonnegative integer and then uses a loop to calculate the factorial of that number. Print out the factorial
